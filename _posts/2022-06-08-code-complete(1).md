作者在第一章节讨论了这本书讨论的边际范围 - "construction".

关注点在: "Coding and Debuging", "Detailed Design", "Construction Planning", "Unit Testing", "Integration", "Integration Tesing", "Other activites in roughly".

有一些具体的例子，如:
1. Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully.
2. Determining how your code will be tested.
3. Desiging and writing classes and routines.
4. Creating and naming variables and named constants.
5. Selectig control structures and organizing blocks of statements.
6. Unit tesing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
7. Reviweing other team memebers' low-level designs and code and having them review yours.
8. Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it.
9. Integrating software components that wre created separately.
10. Tuning code to make if faster and use fewer resources.

Imoriving software quality and developer productivity is important.
 
阅读的几个关注点：
1. Construction is a large part of software development. Construction typically takes 30 to 80 percent of the total time spent on a project.
2. Construction is the central activity on software developement. Before construction the architecture are done, and after construction system testing will be done.
3. With a focus on construction, the individual programmers' productivity can imporve enormously.
4. Construction's product, the source code, is often the only accurate description of the software.
5. Construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to be done.
