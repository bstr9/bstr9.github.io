## Metaphors(隐喻) for a Richer
### Understanding of Software Development
Important developments often arise out of analogies(来源于类比). By comparing a topic you understand poorly to something similar you understand better, you can come up with insights(洞察力) that result in a better understanding of the less-familiar topic. --> This is "modeling".

建模来源于和类比。

In general, the power of models is that they're vivid and can be grasped as conceptual wholes.

建模的力量在于能够鲜明的从整体把握概念。

使用亚里士多德对落石的视角是重物落下，伽利略对落石的视角是钟摆，因而建模不同得到的结论不同。这个案例作为例子来解释，不同的视角决定了最终的建模不同。

没有绝对正确的Metaphors，只有相对更好的Metaphors。Not just wrong or right, but worse or better.

### How to Use Software Metaphors
A software metaphors is more like a searchlight(探照灯) than a road map. It doesn't tell you where to find the answer, it tells you how to look for it. It's more as a heuristic(启发式) than it does as an algorithm.

Metaphors是一种方法论。

A heuristic tells you how to discover the instructions for yourself, or at least where to look for them.

How to use software metaphors?
Use them to give you insight into your programming problems and processes. Use them to help you think about your programming activities and to help you imagine better ways of doing things. 


### Common Software Metaphors
#### Software Penmanship: Writing Code
For an individual;s work or for small-scale projects, the letter-writing metaphor worker adequately, but for other purposes it leaves the party eraly -- it doesn't describe software development fully or adequately.
Software project will most likely involve many people with many different responsibilities.

In software construction, trying to create truly original work is often less effective than focusing on the reuse of design ideas, code, and test cases from previous projects.

#### Software Farming: Growing a System
这个理论是认为，软件应该像种植一样，撒种子收获结果。设计一小段代码，开发一小段代码，测试一小段代码，然后将它集成到系统中去。这样每一步都很小，所以每一步遇到的困难和麻烦都很小。

Sometimes a good technique is described with a bad metaphor. 好的技术被坏的方法论描述了。这里方法论不足以描述上面的实际操作手段。上面的操作手段是好的，但是不应该用这个方法论去解释。

如果使用这种方式去解释软件开发的话，会发现实际强调的是完善系统的计划、细化详细设计、通过有效的方式管理代码本身。但是它的缺点是，你没有直接的控制到软件的开发过程。
